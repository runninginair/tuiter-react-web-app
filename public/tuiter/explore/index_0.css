4 Tuiter (50pts)

For the tuiter section of this assignment you are going to continue implementing
the Tuiter website started in previous assignments. You will use the Bootstrap and
Fontawesome CSS libraries to reimplement the Explore screen. Do all your work in
public/tuiter/explore/index.html and public/tuiter/explore/index.css.

Tuiter's explore screen displays a list of random tuits organized into several
categories accessible by tabs.

An illustration is shown in the Extra extra large section that follows. The screen,
as most Tuiter screens we'll work on, have three columns. The column on the left is
a navigation sidebar with links to various screens throughout Tuiter. The column in
the middle contains the main content, and the column on the right is another side
bar with links to other users you might want to follow. The list of tuits in the
main content, rendered in the center column, are categorized by For You, Trending,
News, Sports, and Entertainment. The default selected tab is For You. The tabs point
to for-you.html, trending.html, news.html, sports.html, and entertainment.html
respectively. You don't need to implement those Webpages. The goal of this section
is to implement the explore.html Webpage so that it looks and behaves as close as
possible to how it is described here and displayed in the sections that follow.

As you work on explore.html, the following is a few things worth pointing out,

1. The navigation on the left has both icons and text
2. The link to the current page is highlighted, e.g., # Explore
3. There is a small margin at the top of the page, below the navigation links on
   the left, below the search field, below the tabs
4. The width of the Tuit button is the same as the navigation bar above it
5. The main content is centered with equal margins on either side
6. There's an equal spacing between the three columns
7. The Follow buttons on the Who to follow side bar on the right are vertically centered
8. The search field has a magnifying glass rendered within its border, and the text and
   placeholder start to the right of the icon
9. The image at the top of the middle column has a large white text overlayed on top of
   it, but positioned in the bottom left corner of the image
10. The cog on the right of the search field is vertically aligned with the search field
11. The search field has rounded corners
12. The borders of the avatar images under Who to follow are circles. Do not use circle
    images. Use rounded corners instead
13. Use images similar to the ones shown. Use the text shown as a hint to find images on
    the Web
14. Use the exact text shown
