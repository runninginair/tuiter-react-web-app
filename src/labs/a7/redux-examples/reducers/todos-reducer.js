/**     2.5 Retrieving state from a reducer
 * 
 * Redux allows maintaining the state of an application. The state changes over time as
 * the user interacts with the application. There are four basic ways we interact with data:
 * create data, read data, update date, and delete data. We often refer to these operations
 * by the acronym CRUD. Let's implement a small todo app to illustrate the CRUD operations.
 * In the same reducers directory created earlier, create the reducer for the todo app in a
 * file called todos-reducer.js. Copy the content below into the file.
